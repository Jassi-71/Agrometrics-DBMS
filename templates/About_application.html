    <img class="centerclass" src="https://www.mobindustry.net/wp-content/uploads/1539586765146186b72d2e9.jpg" style="padding-top: 40px;">

        <div style="padding-top: 30px;">Farmers are of prime importance to the Indian Economy. Their hard work is essential for the growth of any civilization. This leads to the main motive behind building this application, which is to enable the farmers with powerful technology to protect themselves against any fraudulent activities and enable them to sell crops at competitive prices along with a proper guidance system which can potentially help them to grow and make informative decisions.
            The aim is to promote uniformity in agriculture marketing by streamlining procedures across the integrated markets, detaching information asymmetry between buyers and sellers and encouraging real-time price discovery based on actual demand and supply.
        </div>
        <div style="padding-top: 30px;">The analyst research team can analyse data about selling and buying pattern, crops growth etc. Moreover, farmers can track their growth and make informed decisions about their earnings. These all can lead to the effective growth of farmers both financially and mentally. Traders will also have a greater number of options to choose from and can buy the best quality crops at reasonable prices. The government can also ensure that prices paid to farmers are greater than MSP.</div>
        <div style="padding-top: 30px;">In a world where the farmerâ€™s hard work is of such importance, there we find that they are unable to sell crops at reasonable prices or get information that would help them make smart choices. Traders also find it difficult as they also do not have many choices and cannot buy the best quality crops at reasonable prices. Moreover, the Government and Mandi House do not have data of crops bought or sold and the problems faced by farmers and traders.</div>
        <div style="padding-top: 30px;">Our platform will provide them with relevant data and assistance to ensure transparency in trade.</div>
