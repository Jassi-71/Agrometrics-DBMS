# AGROMETRICS - 
Application that gives wings to farmers.

In a world where the farmer’s hard work is of such importance, there we find that they are unable to sell crops at reasonable prices or get information that would help them make smart choices. 

Traders also find it difficult as they also do not have many choices and cannot buy the best quality crops at reasonable prices. Moreover, the Government and Mandi House do not have data of crops bought or sold and the problems faced by farmers and traders. 

Our platform will provide them with relevant data and assistance to ensure transparency in trade.
